- A server of a booking app -> https://github.com/honglu2875/Bookit-dbManager
  - A demonstration by combining with a simple (and buggy) frontend using docker-compose -> https://github.com/honglu2875/Bookit-proof-of-concept
  - Live demonstration: https://meet.honglu.fan:5000
- A server allowing Tradingview users to actually execute trades -> https://github.com/Dr-H2/Tradingview-Webhook-Bot
- Some codes to assist a research on stability of CNNs -> https://github.com/honglu2875/weirdonetworks
- Some codes to assist a hobby experiment on reinforcement learning -> https://github.com/honglu2875/SkynetTheMarketCrusher
- and a handful of *private* repos that currently serve their duties in the day-to-day routine of a small startup.
