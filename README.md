Something I have written:
- A server allowing Tradingview users to actually execute trades -> https://github.com/Dr-H2/Tradingview-Webhook-Bot
- Some codes to assist a research on stability of CNNs -> https://github.com/honglu2875/weirdonetworks
- Some codes to assist a hobby experiment on reinforcement learning -> https://github.com/honglu2875/SkynetTheMarketCrusher
- and a handful of *private* repos that currently serve their duties in the day-to-day routine of a small startup.
